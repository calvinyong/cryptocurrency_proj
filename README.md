# Cryptocurrency Summer Project 2018

May 2018 - Aug 2018

Ten students, including I, wrote up a quantitative analysis on cryptocurrencies, that studied factors (volatility, volume), correnations, and outlier detection and removal methods. We analyzed about 72GB of tick-level data given to us by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) that consisted of 38 cryptocurrency pairs, 14 exchanges, and 3 regions. I was a team leader in this project, and I wrote the majority of the code shown in this repo.

Originally, we were split into two team of five, each team with a team leader. In the end, we were a group of 10 with 2 team leaders.

## Descriptions of programs/files

- `projLists.py`: Important varaibles for the project
- `projfuncs.py`: Functions reused during the project. The most notable file in this repo.
- `program2.py`: Plot trade data given data source, date, and crypto pair. Plot in plotly or matplotlib.
- `program3.py`: Plot quote data
- `program4.py`: Outputs csv file with trade/quote counts and trade volume for each pair and date
- `program5a.py`: Plot quote data (bid or ask) for each exchange, given a date and crypto pair
- `program5b.py`: Same as `program5a.py`, but for trade data.
